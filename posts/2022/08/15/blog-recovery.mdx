title: "Blog recovery  #Life"

This blog has been offline since at least early July. Something apparently went wrong with an automatic WordPress upgrade.

Rather than ferret out the problem, I decided to use the opportunity to switch away from WordPress and write a new React front-end for my existing content. I've been wanting to write some custom components for my blog anyway, like [Bootstrap-style alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/alerts/). *How hard could it be?* I asked myself. How young and foolish I was.

But, six weeks later, here it is! Partially. I'm porting the posts over in batches, because I have to fix syntax as I go. I'll also make some effort to fix old broken links. I'll work my way from [oldest](/2004/05/15/systemcomponentmodel) to newest.

I'll post another update when it's all cut over.
