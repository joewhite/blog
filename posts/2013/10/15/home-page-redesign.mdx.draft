<p>The <a href="http://www.excastle.com/">excastle.com</a> home page has been looking pretty drab for years now. Recently I decided to flex my creative muscles and make it look prettier, with the power of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a> (props to <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/castle-walls-isometric-64-x-128">extradave</a> and <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/pixel-farm-and-shack">pixel32</a>).</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.excastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ExCastlePre2013.png" alt="ExCastle.com, pre-2013" width="600" height="245" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3832" /></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.excastle.com/"><img src="http://blog.excastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ExCastle2013.png" alt="ExCastle.com, circa 2013" width="600" height="386" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3835" /></a></p>

<p>This was a fun way to spend a Saturday, and I like how it turned out. I'm still not going to call myself a graphic designer, but at least the page won't put you to sleep <em>right</em> away.</p>
