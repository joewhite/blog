Fame and fortune, here I come.</p>

<p>I've finally (almost two weeks after learning about Script Frenzy, three days before curtain) decided on a plot... of sorts. It's still just the one-sentence summary from Step 1 of the <a href="http://www.ingermanson.com/writing/snowflake.php">Snowflake Method</a>. But hey, it's a start, right? Here's what I've got:</p>

<blockquote>In the modern Midwest, a teenager must rescue the girl she loves from a power-hungry Faerie Lord.</blockquote>

<p>We'll see if I'm still using that same plot by the time June is over.</p>

<p>As with this past NaNoWriMo (which I never did actually finish), I'll be writing this on <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, so I can share it with a few people without making it totally public. That way, I can sell it for more money when all the Hollywood studios come knocking my door down. Denial springs eternal, and all that.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want to read along as I write. My contact form doesn't seem to be working (grumble grumble blog software that doesn't report the actual mail server error grumble grumble), but you can e-mail me using my hotmail address, which has "ip255" before the at sign. Put something about Script Frenzy in the subject line so I know not to feed you to my <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/02/13/just-spam-lite-please-my-hamsters-on-a-diet/">hamster</a>.</p>
