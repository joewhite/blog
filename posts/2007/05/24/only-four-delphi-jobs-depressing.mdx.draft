<p><a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/davidi">DavidI</a> just posted about <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/davidi/archive/2007/05/22/34753.aspx">Delphi developer jobs available in the US</a>. He said "some of you have asked me where the Delphi jobs are... You can always find the latest Delphi job openings at the PermIT job openings site."</p>

<p>I checked it out. They only list five Delphi job openings for the entire United States, and one of them is closed.</p>

<p>My question is, why list the closed one? Wouldn't just listing four have been depressing enough?</p>
