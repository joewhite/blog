<p>CodeGear's new CEO is serious about "<a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/jimdouglas/archive/2007/04/10/33850.aspx">First Quality Experience</a>".</p>

<p>Delphi 2007 was released <a href="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/Delphi2007GoesGold.aspx">March 16</a> &mdash; over six weeks ago. But as of the beginning of this week, we <i>still</i> didn't have the copies that we had already paid for via Software Assurance. This is the <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2006/01/24/delphi-2006-is-here/">second year in a row</a> they've done this.</p>

<p>So on Monday, after talking to my boss, I e-mailed Jim Douglas directly, because this is exactly the sort of "quality" he commented on wanting to improve.</p>

<p>I can't confirm blogger <a href="http://www.myblogthoughts.com/wp">Jim</a>'s experience of hearing back "<a href="http://www.myblogthoughts.com/wp/?p=13">within a few minutes</a>". (Not surprising; a CEO is a busy guy. When he first e-mailed me back, he had just gotten off a plane.) But I <i>can</i> say that, two days later, I've received e-mails back from CodeGear's CEO, their VP of North American Sales, and their Senior Director of Global Customer Support. And we have Delphi 2007.</p>
