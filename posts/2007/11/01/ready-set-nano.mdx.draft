<p>All right, I couldn't come up with a better title than that. Sorry. It's early.</p>

<p>People have been asking me what my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> novel will be about this year, and my answer has been, "I have no idea." But I got Chinese food for lunch yesterday, and my fortune cookie said, "Tomorrow your creative side will shine forth with exceptional ideas."</p>

<p>If that ain't a good omen, I don't know what is. So... I'm off to write a novel. Wish me luck!</p>
