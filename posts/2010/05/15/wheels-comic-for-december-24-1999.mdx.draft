The cop is smirking because he knows exactly <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/08/wheels-comic-for-december-17-1999/">how</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/10/wheels-comic-for-december-19-1999/">good</a> Max has been this year...

I used <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/11/wheels-comic-for-december-20-1999/">extra-fine-point Sharpies</a> on this strip too, e.g. for the details on the characters' faces, and the strands of Christmas lights. I think this one turned out a little better.
