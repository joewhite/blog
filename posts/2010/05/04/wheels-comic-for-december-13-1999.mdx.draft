<a href="http://wheels.excastle.com/">Wheels</a> debuted on November 1, 1999. This is the first strip after I started as writer and artist, on December 13, 1999. It looks like I don't have copies of anything earlier.

<a href="http://jennie.excastle.com/">Jennie</a> was my unofficial co-writer. Today's (?) strip was one of her ideas.
