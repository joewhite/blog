<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/11/wheels-comic-for-december-20-1999/">Lenny's date</a> must have gone well.

The guy with the y'all and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Star_State">Lone Star</a> belt buckle is Tex. He's from the South, where "y'all" is singular. (The plural is "all y'all".)
