<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/08/wheels-comic-for-december-17-1999/">Max's</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/07/wheels-comic-for-december-16-1999/">name</a> first appears in the comic.

I like the contrast between Max's and <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2010/05/09/wheels-comic-for-december-18-1999/">Lenny's</a> styles when confronted by the authorities.
