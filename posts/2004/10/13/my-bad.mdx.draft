<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Okay, Diamondback isn't actually out yet. The Oslo launch event <em>was</em> a "build hype and take orders" event like the Delphi 8 launch at BorCon 2003. I should've noticed the "Pre-Order" on the order page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.borland.com/news/press_releases/2004/10_12_04_delphi2005_boosts_windows_productivity.html">Word is</a> that it'll be out in November sometime.</p>
