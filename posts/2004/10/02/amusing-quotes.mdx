Some amusing stuff I found while looking for something else. (Isn't that always how it goes?)

Purported "<a href="http://www.mistupid.com/people/page027.htm">Bad Metaphors from Stupid Student Essays</a>". I doubt any of these ever came from anything resembling a student essay, but they're still pretty good. Here are a few:

> Shots rang out, as shots are wont to do.

> He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame duck either, but a real duck that was actually lame. Maybe from stepping on a land mine or something.

> The dandelion swayed in the gentle breeze like an oscillating electric fan set on medium.

(I think some of these are going to become <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> dares.)

Another page on the same site has a fairly compelling explanation of <a href="http://www.mistupid.com/people/page058.htm">how corporate policies come to be</a>. Complete with monkeys.
