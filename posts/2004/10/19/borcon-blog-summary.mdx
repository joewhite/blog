<a href="http://blogs.slcdug.org/esaputra/">Erwien Saputra</a> contacted me a while back. He wanted to put together a compilation of all the BorCon blogs, and asked permission to use my blog content. (Basically doing what I was trying to do with the BorCon wiki, except unlike me, Erwien actually got it finished.) He got pretty much all the blogs pulled into one place and grouped by category, and it's now published on BDN. Pretty comprehensive. <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,32752,00.html">Check it out</a>.
