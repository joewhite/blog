<p>It's been a good week. First, <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/9808028.htm?1c">part of the Patriot Act was struck down</a>. And then the Federal Marriage Amendment Reloaded <a href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/3/182961-3163-010.html">lost its vote in the House</a>.</p>
<p>Not quite as decisively as last time, when <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/07/14/federal-marriage-amendment-defeated/">the Senate couldn't even get a simple majority</a> to move the amendment forward. This time in the House, it actually did get a simple majority (I can't believe there are that many people willing to put politics ahead of human decency), but they were still well short of the 2/3 supermajority they needed. Even if it probably wouldn't have passed the Senate, it's good to see it dead again. For this year, at least.</p>
<p><a href="http://leeterry.house.gov/">Lee Terry</a>, my representative, voted in favor of the amendment. He also voted in favor of the "<a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/amar/20040806.html">Marriage Protection Act</a>". He just found his name on my "please God, anyone but" list along with Bush.</p>
