<p>We're joining the throngs of people with tax deductions and lawnmowers. Yes, indeed, we just closed on the house. Hooray!</p>
<p>Oddly enough, not only did we not have to bring money to closing, but through one convolution and another, we actually got money back. (Which was good, because we didn't get the final word on the numbers until half an hour before closing, which wouldn't have left any time to stop by the bank to get a cashier's check.) In fact, whenever the wire transfer comes through, we'll get our entire earnest deposit back! Of course, any money we get back now is money we'll have to pay back with interest later, but it helps with the little things, like the doors that need replacing, and of course the lawnmower situation. And going out to eat to celebrate (after we get our vacuum, bed, washing machine, and cats moved in). We deserve it. Or will by then, anyway; it's bleeping humid out there.</p>
<p>But, wow. We have a house. I'm not sure it's sunk in yet. It'll probably do that at 2:00 in the morning again.</p>
<p>And now, on to moving. Yecch.</p>
