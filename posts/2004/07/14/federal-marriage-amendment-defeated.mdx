sort: 1981

<p>The anti-gay amendment was <a href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Press_Room&CONTENTID=21202&TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm">killed in the Senate</a>. Not only did they not get the 2/3 majority it would have taken to pass the amendment in the Senate, they didn't even have a simple majority supporting the thing!</p>
<p>It's a major victory, and at the same time, it's nothing but a holding pattern. Nothing gained. But, at least, nothing lost.</p>
