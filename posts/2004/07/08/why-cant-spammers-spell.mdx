<p>Honestly. "Your account information needs to be renew"? "Deletation"? And these people want me to think it's PayPal sending me this message?</p>
<p>And people actually fall for this. I can understand them being bamboozled by the hyperlink (especially since Hotmail encourages scams by obfuscating the URL), but come on, don't people read? It's scary, if a bit Darwin-Awardish. Economic survival of those with the fittest educations.</p>
<p>Still, it's sad. You really would think that, after succesfully scamming their first victim, they'd be able to pay for a proofreader.</p>
