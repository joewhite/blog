<p>I <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/07/28/resharper-not-ready/">posted about ReSharper</a> yesterday. This morning I had a comment from Oleg Stepanov, one of the ReSharper developers, waiting in my e-mail. He had seen my blog post and was responding to it. Wow.</p>
<p>Among his responses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ReSharper's highlighting colors are customizable via the standard VS Tools &gt; Options. I'm impressed that they're that deeply rooted into Visual Studio; I didn't expect to find an add-on's settings there. (Well, it did occur to me at one point, and I probably would have gotten to there eventually, if not for the errors.) But hey, now I know.</li>
  <li>They already know about the multi-monitor issues, and they'll be fixed in one of the bugfix updates.</li>
  <li>He says the exceptions are related to invalid metadata in one of our assemblies. Given some of the problems we've had with the Delphi 8 compiler, that's entirely possible.</li>
  <li>There actually <em>is</em> a <a href="http://www.intellij.net/tracker/resharper/browse">Tracker for ReSharper bugs</a>. But I'll be buggered if I can find any links to it (except in his e-mail).</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, it looks like a nice product... but we certainly can't use the current version. I'll see if I can work with them to track down the problems it's running into, in hopes of getting a working-for-us version a little sooner.</p>
