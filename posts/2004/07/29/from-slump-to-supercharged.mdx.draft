<p>Chris Woodruff <a href="http://dotnetdelphi.blogspot.com/2004/07/some-good-reading-dexterity-software.html">pointed out</a> a <a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/">set of articles by Steve Pavlina of Dexterity Software</a>. Very interesting reading. It's mostly targeted at game developers, but most of the content is general-interest. How to sell software, how to manage your time, how to motivate yourself. I'll need to spend some more time reading this stuff.</p>
<p>Unlike Chris, I can't say that reading "<a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/from-slump-to-supercharged.htm">From Slump to Supercharged</a>" instantly changed my life... but I printed it out. I'm going to read it a few more times. And show it to Jennie. I think I'll also take a copy in when church youth group starts up in the fall. Whether it'll take immediately, or grow on me slowly, it's got some good things to say. It resonates.</p>
