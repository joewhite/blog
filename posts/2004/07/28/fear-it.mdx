So I posted <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/07/24/bob-the-overlords-blog/">Bob the Overlord's Blog</a> over on the <a href="http://www.writersbbs.com/">Writer's BBS</a>. And vodou quoted the "All shall fear the rage of the marsupials" sentence, and said, "<a href="http://www.writersbbs.com/bbs3/forum.cgi?action=read&amp;forum=scifi&amp;message=4350-4337">I think I want a bumper sticker of that sentence.</a>"

I had to do it. I just had to.

As soon as I finish reading the CafePress legalese, I'll drop three and a half bucks to order myself a bumper sticker. If it looks good, you'll be able to order a Rage of the Marsupials bumper sticker of your very own. Stay tuned.
