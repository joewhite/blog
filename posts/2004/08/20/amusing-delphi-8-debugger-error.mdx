<p>I really hope <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/mswindell/2004/08/diamondback-rumors.html">Diamondback</a>, whenever it comes out, will be more stable than Delphi 8 has been.</p>
<p>I just got this error message when trying to do a Step Over in Delphi 8's debugger:</p>
<p><img height="142" src="/images/D8StepNoSource.png" width="460" /></p>
<p>Visible in the background, as you can see, is the current location (blue background, green arrow), as well as the source for the location I'm attempting to step to (the next line).</p>
<p>And yet Delphi 8 continues to win awards. I should've gone into marketing.</p>
