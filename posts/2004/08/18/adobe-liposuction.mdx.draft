<p>I saw this article a while back, but had to hunt today to find it again. That makes it a good candidate for a blog post, so I can find it again next time.</p>
<p>So anyone who's recently used Adobe Reader (recently = since the name change from Acrobat Reader) knows that it takes a disgusting amount of time to start up. This is because it's loading zillions of plug-ins that nobody needs. You know, the e-book plug-in, the encryption plug-in, the USB toothbrush plug-in, etc.</p>
<p>Hence: <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11041">How to use liposuction to repair Adobe Reader 6</a></p>
