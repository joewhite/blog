<p>It's been a little over a month since I was <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/10/07/screening/">diagnosed with ADD</a>. Today was my first appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about treatment options.</p>
<p>I picked a doctor who specializes in adult ADD, and it showed &#8212; he walked me through a fairly extensive set of questions, never once referring to any notes. We covered a lot of ground, and when were done, he agreed with the existing, informal diagnosis: yes, I definitely have ADD, and no, there's nothing else seriously wrong with me psychiatrically (though he was intrigued by my participation in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>).</p>
<p>Today I picked up the first of two drugs he's going to try me on, both stimulant-based. (There's a class of non-stimulant drugs, and he asked me which type I'd like to try; but he said that the non-stimulants take around six weeks to kick in, and he doesn't usually use them on new patients.) For the next two weeks, I'll be taking Ritalin, starting with a lower dose and gradually working my way up, trying to see what works.</p>
<p>The downside is, since it's a stimulant, I need to avoid mixing it with other stimulants. Meaning, I need to stop drinking caffeine. Ouch.</p>
