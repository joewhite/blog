<p>I put this blog online on Saturday. In its own subdirectory. With no links to it yet. After fiddling with the configuration for about twenty minutes, I posted an <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/05/15/systemcomponentmodel/">entry</a> into my brand-new blog.</p>
<p>Seven minutes later, the first spider hit my server log. Now I'm getting dozens of hits per day, most or all of them from spiders. Apparently you can't hide. (Not that my blog is particularly secret, but wow...)</p>
<p>My best guess is that urbanpotato.net (the site I linked to in that first blog entry) has a publicly-accessible referer log somewhere, and which spiders regularly, um, spider. But I've looked and if there is one, I can't find it. Either that, or DotText does some sort of secret notification to the blog Illuminati.</p>
<p>Either way, it's spooky.</p>
