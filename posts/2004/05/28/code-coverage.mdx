<p>NCover may be worth a look. In my copious spare time. Code-coverage analysis could be a Good Thing (tm) for test-driven development. (Apparently the people who wrote NCover thought so too.)</p>
<p>Actually, there are <BrokenLink href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Thread.aspx?id=183326">two</BrokenLink> apps out there that are both called NCover. One is on <a href="http://ncover.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> and the other is on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051216170557/http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?ID=3122EE1A-46E7-48A5-857E-AAD6739EF6B9">GotDotNet Workspaces</a>. The SourceForge one has a <a href="http://ncover.sourceforge.net/sample-output/NCover-report.html">sample report</a> on their Web site (showing its own test coverage) that looks pretty tempting, but the GotDotNet one has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051216015035/http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?ID=03791D39-B33A-4021-81FB-DB5B28CF984F">Visual Studio integration</a>. Both projects seem fairly active.</p>
<p>Here's a <BrokenLink href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/csunit/message/486">post&nbsp;from the csUnit mailing list</BrokenLink> on how to use the GotDotNet NCover with csUnit.</p>
<p>If I ever get around to trying either one, I'll post my experiences here. (Has anyone else tried either or both of them?)</p>
