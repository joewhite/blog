<p><a href="http://homepages.borland.com/abauer/index.php">Allen Bauer</a> just posted about <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/abauer/2004/05/charlottes-web.php?show_id=108509470991637507#bk_108509470991637507">the fate of "Charlotte"</a>. Apparently it hasn't been developed further as a product, but parts of it have wound up in the CodeDOM system in C#Builder and Delphi for .NET.</p>
<p>So as I read his post, I was scratching my head and wondering what "Charlotte" <em>was.</em></p>
<p>A brief Google search for <font face="Courier New">borland<font face="Times New Roman"> </font>charlotte</font> found a <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/events/2002.htm">page on Dr. Bob's site</a> that briefly mentioned Charlotte as a scripting language for writing Web services. Now I'm really curious... it's hard to hear about a new language (even one that won't be released) and not even see any sample code. The sign of a true geek, I guess.</p>
<p>As it happens, that very same Google search also turned up this very interesting page: "<a href="http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2003/01/03/Floridian/You_don_t_mess_with_a.shtml">If ever a story called for further reporting, this one did.</a>" The fact that the word Charlotte appears in this story is apparently just a coincidence, though an amusingly appropriate one.</p>
