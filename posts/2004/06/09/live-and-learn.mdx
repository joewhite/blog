<p>So as I was packing boxes, I ran across some stuff I wrote maybe eight or ten years ago (good grief, has it been that long?). One was a list of things I was thinking of sending in for the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558538380/qid%3D1086833096/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-9408792-6414223">Live and Learn and Pass it On</a>" books but never did, and I figured they might be worth passing on before I pack them away again. As in the real books, I've put some of them in bold just because I feel like it.</p>
<p>I've learned that few things are quite as satisfying as impulsive, totally spontaneous acts.</p>
<p>I've learned that, no matter what you think your attitudes are, you still don't quite know how to react when you find out one of your friends is gay.</p>
<p>I've learned that, while most people cling to the things they know, I'm usually happiest when I'm doing something new.</p>
<p>I've learned that the only stupid people are those who are ignorant and refuse to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>I've learned that the surest way to offend me is to try too hard not to offend me.</strong></p>
<p>I've learned that "crazy" means something you want to do but that society frowns on for some reason &#8212; and you shouldn't necessarily let that stop you.</p>
<p>I've learned that trying to recapture a fleeting emotion is a sure way to get yourself really frustrated.</p>
<p>I've learned that everyone is always trying to get attention, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<p>I've learned that sometimes you can't tell if what you're doing is a mistake, and if it turns out to be, you shouldn't be hard on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>I've learned that there's no point in worrying about the things you can't change.</strong></p>
<p>I've learned that, no matter how much people may long for security and consistency, it's always randomness that really makes life worth living.</p>
<p>I've learned that you can't blame yourself for not knowing everything.</p>
