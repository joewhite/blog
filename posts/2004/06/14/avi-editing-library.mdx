<p>Boy, what I wouldn't have given to have found <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/aviFileWrapper.asp">this AVI-editing library</a> a couple of years ago. Build AVIs frame-by-frame, extract frames from an existing AVI, change compression, add sound, remove sound... wow. Comes with a sample app that lets you do all that from a GUI, or you can do it all from code.</p>
<p>The library is written in C#, but since Delphi is limited to AVIs for animation, the sample app would make a great utility for Delphi UI developers. (.NET programmers can just use animated GIFs...)</p>
