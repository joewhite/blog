<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/treemaps.asp">This post</a> on CodeProject talks about squarified treemaps, which are an interesting way of visualizing the same kind of data that you might otherwise put on a pie chart. Treemaps are foreign-looking the first time you see them, but they would have some benefits over pie charts: with treemaps you don't lose all that space in the corners, and you also have a better way of viewing small segments &#8212; instead of being itty-bitty really-thin slices, they're somewhat-small squares. The article wanders far afield, and its code samples are for Avalon, so not useful for apps today; but the first quarter or so of the article contains a walkthrough on the squarified-treemap algorithm, which has plenty of illustrations and explains the algorithm quite well.</p>
<p>On a different note (though still on data visualization), take a look at this amazing <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/">interactive ZIP Code map</a>. Imagine that kind of interactivity in a combo-box's dropdown.</p>
