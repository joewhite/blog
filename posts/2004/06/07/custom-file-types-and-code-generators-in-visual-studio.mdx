Ran across <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/config.asp">an article on CodeProject</a> that does some interesting things. It adds a new file type to the File New dialog (an "xfg" file, which as it turns out is kind of like a .config file), and when you add an .xfg file to your project, it automatically creates a code-behind .cs file with strongly-typed properties for reading the XML. Looks pretty slick, and worth looking into in my copious spare time.
