<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2004/06/22/162533.aspx">Pretty sweet</a>. Build a new list containing all the elements in another list that meet certain criteria... with a single method call and an anonymous delegate. Passing an anonymous delegate as a comparer to Sort. Building a list that contains some other list's elements run through some conversion (like Perl's <font face="Courier New">map</font> function). Nice stuff. Pity about the stylesheet, though...</p>
