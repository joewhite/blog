<p>The forces of truth, justice, decency, and general sanity are sadly outnumbered, mostly by Fundamentalists who haven't figured out how to think for themselves.</p>
<p>In other news, there's unrest in the Middle East, the government is in debt, and there are big orange road cones all over the city of Omaha. Yes, shocking tidings in the news today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hrc.org/">HRC</a> just announced that the so-called "<a href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Federal_Constitutional_Marriage_Amendment">Federal Marriage Amendment</a>" will come up for a vote in the Senate in early July. Per their suggestion, I made substantial tweaks to their template and fired off an e-mail to my senators (to add to the other e-mails, the laser-printed letters, and the six-page hand-written letter).</p>
<p>This is the <em>only</em> political issue I've ever gotten active over, which tells you something about how seriously I take it and how disgusted I am with those who want to redefine gays as non-people. I mean, come on. Nobody has <em>ever once</em> been able to explain why they think my marriage would be harmed if a couple I know from church got married... or why gays should be denied everything from tax breaks to child custody rights to health insurance and hospital visitation, or <a href="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/og97016.pdf">over 1,000 other rights</a> (PDF) that married couples enjoy. There are <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/parent.html">several</a> <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;109/2/341">studies</a> <a href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Ask_the_Experts&CONTENTID=10767&TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm">showing</a> that children of gay couples are just as well-adjusted as children of straight couples. The <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_marj.htm">Bible quotes</a> commonly cited by anti-gay Fundamentalists don't actually say what the Fundamentalists want you to think they do. Etc.</p>
<p>I'll keep the rant short today (unless it's already too late for that...), and not go into civil unions and all that brouhaha. I'll just leave it as a plea for action. According to HRC, "Members of Congress tell us they're hearing from the other side by a 10 to 1 margin right now. That's why your action now is so important." So if you don't buy into the load of crap that Dubya and the Fundies are dishing out, <a href="http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/senate_oppose_fma/forward2"><strong>go here to e-mail your Senators</strong></a>. HRC is trying to get 250,000 people to participate within the next three weeks. Let's strike a victory for truth, justice, and the American way &#8212; and not let our Constitution be consumed in the fires of brimstone. (Hey, I like the sound of that.)</p>
<p>Hmm... "Dubya and the Fundies" would make a good name for a band...</p>
