<a href="http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/">Jonathan de Halleux</a> started an open-source site called <a href="http://ncollection.tigris.org/">NCollection</a>, where people can contribute the collection classes that are missing from .NET (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/TreeCollection.asp">trees</a>, sets, linked lists, ternary search trees, circular buffers, etc.) and put them all in one namespace. They'll be emphasizing coding standards and peer review, unit testing (using <a href="http://mbunit.tigris.org/">MbUnit</a>), and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">FxCop</a>. Very, very cool. If I get some time off from packing, I need to check them out; maybe I could contribute a HistoryList/UndoList.
