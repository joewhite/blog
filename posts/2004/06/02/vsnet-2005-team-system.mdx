<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/default.aspx">Visual Studio .NET 2005 Team System</a> (quite a mouthful!) looks like it'll be pretty interesting... they're combining source control (using something new, not based on the VSS code base), <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">FxCop</a>, and a bunch of other things that are supposed to support non-developers (analysts, testers, etc.) as well as the coders.</p>
<p>Pretty interesting. Though a lot of it sounds like they're imitating <a href="http://www.borland.com/starteam/">StarTeam</a>&nbsp;(though they're partnering with Borland as well &#8212; that should be interesting), and throwing in FxCop so they can start getting some money out of it. (The free version of FxCop will continue to exist, but it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/askburton/archive/2004/05/24/140350.aspx#142881">sounds like development on it will stop</a> [except upgrading it to support newer frameworks] once Team System is released. Bleah.)</p>
<p>More info, and an ongoing Q&amp;A session, are available in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/askburton/archive/2004/05/24/140350.aspx">this blog post</a>. Unfortunately, <em>nobody</em> has a clue about pricing yet.</p>
