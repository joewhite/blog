<p>I usually don't bother posting about things I see on <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/dthorpe/blog/delphi/">Danny Thorpe</a>'s, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/">Eric Gunnerson</a>'s, or <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</a>'s blogs, because I figure, hey, how many people are there in the world who do read my blog, but not theirs?</p>
<p>Not too stinkin' many. But here are a few recent posts that are just too good not to pass on.</p>
<p>Raymond Chen posted about the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/08/23/218838.aspx">games after the Games</a>. Wow.</p>
<p>Danny Thorpe <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/dthorpe/blog/delphi/2004_09_01_archive.php#109406077855290368">posted about</a> someone who <a href="http://troutgirl.com/blog/index.php?/archives/46_Shitcanned.html">got fired for blogging</a>. ("How do you spot a pioneer? Look for the arrows in their back.") Many people are now boycotting Friendster for their boneheadedness.</p>
<p>And Eric Gunnerson <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/09/01/224260.aspx">pointed out</a> a song about <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7962.aspx">Chris Sells at Burning Man</a>. Destined to be a classic. (I really must subscribe to <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory's blog</a>. Ever since his post about <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1303.aspx">Longhorn</a>...)</p>
