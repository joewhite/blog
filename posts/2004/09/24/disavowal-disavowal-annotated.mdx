Borland just posted a <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,32717,00.html">new license agreement for the Diamondback preview</a>.

My <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/15/disavowal/">disavowal</a> is hereby disavowed. I don't know what I was talking about when I wrote that.

Of course, I could decide to be paranoid, and say that they can't actually change the license agreement, since the first one was very clear about being the entire, final and exclusive agreement (clause 9.4) between me and Borland, and no provision was made for amending it, even in writing. But... I won't.

You guys might want to think about dropping that "entire, final and exclusive" bit, though. Mistakes do get made from time to time, and it's nice to give yourself a way to correct them. :-P

Here are the diffs between the two licenses, in case anyone's interested.
