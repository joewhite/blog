<p>For a while, I've been thinking about writing a choose-your-own-adventure wiki. Imagine ten people collaboratively writing 500,000 words of choose-your-own-adventure in a month. (Hmm, would the text of the choices count toward the word-count goal?)</p>
<p>It turns out <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/">somebody beat me to it</a>. There are a few things I was thinking about doing differently (like allowing anyone to edit existing pages, and having RSS feeds), but what they've got is pretty functional.</p>
<p>It's also proven to be quite amusing; since anyone can contribute, they get some colorful stuff (amid the stuff that's just stupid). <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/3763/">One of the story pages</a> includes the text "All those martial arts movies you watched as a kid really come in handy in this busy Roman marketplace.", and the choices from that point include "Offer his horse some peanut butter". I may have to make a <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> dare out of those phrases come November.</p>
<p>(In case anyone is curious, the track of choices that led there was: <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/story/3/">Another Monday Morning</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/10/">Call in sick</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/36/">Go to the park under the bridge for a game of basketball with the bums</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/357/">You pull out your pistol and shoot them all in the head...</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/372/">go back in time to 6AD</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/choice/3763/">pull a kung-fu move</a>. Nice, logical progression, ain't it?)</p>
<p>I've only added two pages so far. One was just begging to be written (there was a knock at the door, and one of the choices for who was there was "<a href="http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/sbf/room/18179/">Somebody deliver a pizza?</a>" &#8212; I couldn't resist making fun of it). The other was just to cauterize one of the loose ends on a very bizarre story spike that had gone on way too long.</p>
<p>Quite entertaining. I've already spent three evenings reading through the "Another Monday Morning" story alone, and still haven't gotten through all the paths yet.</p>
