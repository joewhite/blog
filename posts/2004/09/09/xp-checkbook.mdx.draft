<p>You know you're tired when...</p>
<p>you're balancing your checkbook, and you start skipping over some of the entries because you're thinking, "Oh, I just need to find input that will make one of my tests fail."</p>
<p>Which is actually sound logic, to a point. The problem is that a non-balanced checkbook can probably be considered equivalent to a red bar, so my tests <em>are</em> failing and I've got work to do (before the red bar becomes red ink).</p>
<p>Not looking forward to the morning. Partly 'cause it's already late and I've got a bunch of checkbook to go, and partly 'cause I really need to get up early enough tomorrow to mow the lawn (since I didn't do it last weekend and I'm about to go out of town for a week). Doesn't help that my muscles are still sore from Tae Kwon Do on Tuesday and I'm about to spend most of tomorrow folded into cattle class. (Here's hoping for an exit row.)</p>
