<p>The gym where my wife works is running a contest. Obviously, employees and family members aren't eligible, but when I went to pick her up tonight and was waiting for her to pack up her stuff, I took a look at the pad of entry forms.</p>
<p>The fine print at the bottom starts off like this: "No purchase necessary. Must be 18 years or older and a member of [gym name] in good standing to enter to win." (Gym name omitted to protect the guilty.)</p>
<p>That's right. No purchase necessary to <em>enter,</em> except for the minor matter of the purchase that's necessary to <em>qualify</em> to enter in the first place.</p>
<p>Jennie isn't actually allowed to talk to customers about how much a membership costs &#8212; only the membership counselors can do that. (You'd think it was a <a href="http://www.excastle.com/vulcanviking/NaNo2002/">union shop</a>, for crying out loud.) So she wasn't 100% sure how much a membership costs, but she did mention that not only do you have to pay a hefty enrollment fee, but you also have to pay a hefty "processing fee". I checked with their Web site to confirm the exact details, and it's true &#8212; $119 enrollment fee, <em>plus</em> $79 processing fee, <em>plus</em> $36.99 per month for the ongoing dues. Ouch.</p>
<p>So there actually is a purchase necessary, to the tune of a minimum of $234.99. But you know, that's such a <em>small</em> thing.</p>
