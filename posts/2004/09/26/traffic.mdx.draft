<p>BorCon has been pretty good to me. Or to my blog, at least.</p>
<p>I was downloading my server logs a couple days ago, and noticed that the size of each day's logfile seemed to be back down to about the same as before BorCon. Then I looked more closely and noticed an extra digit. My server logs before BorCon averaged somewhere around 50k a day, and now they're more like 400k a day. Whew.</p>
<p>My biggest day was September 13, the Monday of BorCon. My server log for that day was a little over 3.5 megs. <a href="http://marcocantu.com/development/borcon2004/default.htm">Most</a> <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/events/2004.htm">of</a> <a href="http://www.lemanix.com/nick/archive/2004/09/12/1280.aspx">that</a> <a href="http://news.jrsoftware.org/read/article.php?id=8031&amp;group=jrsoftware.toolbar2000.thirdparty">was</a> <a href="http://delphi.newswhat.com/geoxml/forumgetthread?groupname=nexusdb.public.discussions&amp;messageid=mpg.1bb406923f492720989897@news.nexusdb.com&amp;displaymode=all">from</a> <a href="http://blog.ahoffma.de/index.php?itemid=696">everyone</a> <a href="http://beensoft.nl/blog/default.aspx?BlogId=24">who</a> linked to my blog of <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/12/john-kasters-diamondback-talk/">John Kaster's preconference tutorial on what's new in Diamondback</a>.

My blog post is evidently <em>the</em> definitive word on that session. It's even been <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/xluke/archive/2004/09/15/104863.aspx">plagiarized</a>.</p>
<p>Since BorCon started, I've had 456 different referers appear in my logs (not counting links from my own domain, or search-agent spiders). And I now have 140 people who reguarly (i.e., more than once within the past week, as identified by both IP address and user-agent) read my RSS feed. There used to be nine.</p>
<p>(Wow. Maybe I'd better come up with something interesting to say one of these days.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough, all this hasn't done much for my Google rank. A Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=joe+white+blog&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">joe white blog</a> places me within the top ten, and has for quite a while; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22joe+white%22+blog&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">"joe white" blog</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=joe+white%27s+blog&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">joe white's blog</a> have long pegged me at #1. But in a search for just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22joe+white%22&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">"joe white"</a>, I'm still lost in the noise &#8212; largely because of some country singer with the nerve to be named Tony Joe White. (Dude, do me a favor and drop the middle name, 'kay?) In that search, I'm somewhere around #368 of 831, when I'm in the search results at all. (Sometimes Google's servers get out of sync, cache weird results, and Google shows duplicate URLs in its results, while I disappear into a seam between search-result pages. I've seen it happen twice now. It's very disqueting to think that Google might have a bug.)</p>
