I had a lot of questions, and they answered most of them right away:

* Transactions? Yes, full transaction support including rollback and disaster recovery
* Client/server? Yes (but also supports local in-process)
* SQL? Yes (SQL-92)

Here's the rest of my notes:

* Short answer: Yes, this is a real database.
* ADO.NET and BDP drivers
* SQL-92 entry-level compliance
* When running locally, can run in-process (remote is TCP/IP)
* Transaction support
  * Log-based, crash recovery, rollback
  * Row-level locking (plus table locking if you want it)
  * Support for read-only transactions
  * High-availability support (automatic and manual failover, incremental backup)
  * Disaster recovery
* Stored procs, user-defined functions, triggers are coded in .NET
  * Direct access to transactional context (you're running in-process on the server)
* Managed code protects the database kernel
* Single DB kernel for multiple editions
  * A lot of vendors prefer to have a "server kernel" and a "micro-kernel" that aren't quite compatible in one way or another
  * NDataStore doesn't; local, server, and high-reliability server all have the same disk structure, identical protocol, same transactiton management, same SQL, etc.
* All this in a single, 1.1 MB DLL
  * That's for ADO.NET. If you want BDP, there are additional DLLs.
* If you want to do client/server, there's a client assembly available that's even smaller.
* Performance: Managed code doesn't make it slower.
  * 64-bit support
* Licensing: Same as JDataStore ($60/seat for desktop version; $500/server for normal server; $1000/server for high-reliability server)
* Faster than mySQL in most benchmarks
  * Note that mySQL does not support disaster recovery (doesn't force writes to flush to disk immediately, so a commit isn't really a commit), and NDataStore is still faster in several benchmarks
  * Obviously, these are vendor benchmarks, so salt grains are required
* Single-file data store
* Zero-admin database: keeps transaction logs only as long as needed (no need to truncate or anything messy like that)
* Next steps:
  * Apply for NDataStore field test (drop off a business card, or e-mail ggoldfield at borland dot com)
  * Will need to sign an NDA, so you may not see me blogging about it :-(
* Interesting note: They actually maintain a single Java codebase, and run a tool to translate into C# with every build!
  * 95% of code is shared
  * Other 5% is .NET platform support (like ADO.NET), and written in C#
* No Delphi/Win32 client yet, but they've broken ground on this and are evaluating it

Sigh. If only they'd had this on the market a month ago. The folks back home (especially John and Jeff) will know what I mean.
