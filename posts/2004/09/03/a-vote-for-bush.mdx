The Omaha World-Herald's top story today, reprinted from the Denver Post, was about <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~29805~2376404,00.html">Bush's acceptance speech for his Republican nomination</a>. (Damn. I was hoping they'd wise up at the last second and nominate somebody else. Hey, hope springs eternal.)
<blockquote>In a speech laced with biblical and patriotic imagery, Bush said Americans have a divine mission to spread freedom and liberty upon the Earth.</blockquote>
"Divine mission". That's right, Bush can't read his own Bible. Excuse me, Mr. President, but America is <em>not</em> God's chosen nation, and we do <em>not</em> have any divinely-sanctioned mission. If there's any chosen nation at all, then <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+7:6-8">we ain't it</a>. News flash, Texas: the Bible <a href="http://www.wisdomquotes.com/000380.html">was not</a> written in America.
<blockquote>"By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America," the president said.</blockquote>
Liberty at home? This from the guy behind the Patriot Act, which gives him the right to arrest anyone without probable cause, and hold them without access to a lawyer, without the right to a speedy trial or in fact any trial at all, without telling their family whether they're even alive or dead, indefinitely, without a shred of evidence? This is <em>liberty?</em>

If you're interested in liberty at home, then <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/irregulargoods/126769">dump Bush</a>.
<blockquote>"Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child."</blockquote>
Cool. He's alienating the entire pro-choice population of the country.
<blockquote>"Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate against them."</blockquote>
Cool. He's alienating everyone who ever donated to a non-religious charity.



<blockquote>"Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges," said the president.</blockquote>
Cool. He's already alienated, and is continuing to work <em>very</em> hard to alienate, everyone who's not a bigot. Including <a href="http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/actioncenter/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=2876887">his own vice president</a>.

But here's the best one:
<blockquote>"[B]ecause we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history..."</blockquote>
Hmm. Yes, the Taliban apparently supported al-Qaeda. <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0707-01.htm">No, Saddam did not.</a> Was the entire Republican party on vacation when the 9/11 commission gave their report? Sure, Saddam was an asshole, but come on, "defending"? Iraq never posed a threat to us. What, exactly, did we piss off the entire civilized world, and set a precedent of unprovoked U.S. aggression, to "defend"?

Actually, that's easy to answer. We were defending Bush's God-given right to declare war against anybody he wants (including and especially U.S. citizens), any time he pleases. We were defending Bush's ego.

You know, I was going to end this post with my usual jab, "A vote for Bush is a vote for bigot pride." (I need to make bumper stickers.)

But with everything else he touched on in his speech... I think I'll rephrase it this time:

"A vote for Bush is just stupid."

This store pretty much sums it up: <a href="http://www.onehorseshy.com/political/anti_bush/">Anyone else in 2004</a>.
