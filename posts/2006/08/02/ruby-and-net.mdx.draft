<p>There's a Ruby package called <a href="http://thinkchiro.com/">RubyCLR</a>. With it, you can write Ruby code that uses .NET assemblies.</p>
<p>It looks pretty amazing. Charlie Poole has a post on how to use it to <a href="http://nunit.com/blogs/?p=30">run NUnit tests from Ruby</a>, and he has code samples. It's just like using Ruby classes, except they're written in .NET. All you need to do is reference the assemblies; the rest is just magic.</p>
<p>Imagine writing a Ruby app that shows a WinForms GUI. Wow.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://blog.briankohrs.com/">Brian</a> just said while looking over my shoulder, "This will have to be played around with."</p>
