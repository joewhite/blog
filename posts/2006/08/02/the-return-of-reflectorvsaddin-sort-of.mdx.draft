<p>I just heard back from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/default.aspx">Jamie Cansdale</a>, who used to maintain the Reflector.VisualStudio add-in. I had e-mailed him a while back wondering where the add-in was, because the write-up in Visual Studio Hacks made it sound like a sweet deal, but it was <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2006/06/08/pimp-your-ide-visual-studio-hacks/">no longer available for download</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out Jamie is also the maintainer for TestDriven.NET, and has released a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2006/08/01/ReflectorAddInLivesAgain.aspx">substitute for the ReflectorVsAddin</a>: it's now part of TestDriven.NET. With the latest version, you can now right-click and Test in &gt; Reflector. Kind of an odd menu selection to make, but it will pop Reflector open right to the symbol you right-clicked (there's an animation showing it off on his "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2006/08/01/ReflectorAddInLivesAgain.aspx">Reflector Add-In Lives Again</a>" blog post). So, way better than having to open Reflector, browse to the right assembly, navigate to the right namespace, etc.</p>
<p>I asked him if the original add-in was still available, since having Reflector right there inside Visual Studio would have been really cool. His response: no, it's not available, because there are Reflector add-ins that don't play nicely if they happen to get loaded inside Visual Studio. So I guess the world is stuck with popping up a separate instance of Reflector. But I think I can live with that.</p>
