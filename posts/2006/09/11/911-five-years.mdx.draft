<p>There's a place in my brain labeled "Things about 9/11 I will Never Forget". I'm embarrassed to say that I'm pretty sure there were once three things in there, and now I can remember only two. But those two are: Yasser Arafat donating blood; and the British palace guard, for the first time in history, standing at attention during the "Star Spangled Banner".</p>
<p>9/11 brought the world together. I hope that that, and not fear, will be its lasting legacy.</p>
