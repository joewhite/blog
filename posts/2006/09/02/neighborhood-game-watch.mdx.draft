<p>It's been nice and cool outside, so we had all our windows open last night and today.</p>
<p>Earlier this afternoon (and still ongoing at sporadic intervals), I've been hearing some very loud, angry-sounding shouting from one of the houses up the street. I was debating with myself over whether to call the police to look into a domestic disturbance.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that there's a Husker game this afternoon.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Pity the grass is still wet. Otherwise I'd go out and finish mowing the lawn.</p>
