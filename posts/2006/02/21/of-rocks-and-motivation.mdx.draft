<p>Less than a day after I posted about <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2006/02/21/of-time-and-rocks/">procrastination as a big rock</a>, <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve</a> posted an article about <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/02/whats-your-motivation-threshold/">motivation thresholds</a>. I think he answered the question I didn't even know how to ask.</p>
<p>Now I just need to find the motivation to re-read his article a few more times until it starts to sink in.</p>
<p>One part of the article that made me laugh out loud, though, was this: "What do you find so motivating that you'd even ignore a growling stomach for hours just to stay with it?" Heh. My answer is, just about <em>anything!</em> Getting started is the hard part, but once I'm started on something that I find interesting, <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/12/16/sleep-whats-that/">hyperfocus</a> takes over, and time, hunger, thirst, sleep, and other human beings all cease to exist.</p>
<p>So now I'm curious. I had thought that getting absorbed in a task was a fairly universal trait among geeks. Steve is clearly a geek (both as a former programmer and as a relentless optimizer), yet apparently he usually notices when he gets hungry. So it's not as universal as I had assumed.</p>
<p>What about you? Do you consider yourself a geek? Do you sometimes get so absorbed in things that you forget to eat?</p>
