<p>I don't watch Boston Legal, but maybe I should.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.boston-legal.org/19-stickit/BL-2x19-Stick-It-ClosingArguments.asx">video clip</a> (Windows Media) from the March 14 episode, titled "<a href="http://www.boston-legal.org/19-stickit/BL-2x19-Stick-It-ClosingArguments.asx">Stick It</a>". A <a href="http://www.boston-legal.org/19-stickit/ep19-stickit.shtml#dialogue">transcript</a> is also available. The clip is of the episode's closing arguments: the defense attorney is making the case for democracy. Sounds a bit odd for a courtroom drama, I know, but it's very well done.</p>
<p>The clip is just over six minutes in length. <a href="http://www.boston-legal.org/19-stickit/BL-2x19-Stick-It-ClosingArguments.asx">Go watch it</a>. It'll give you things to think about.</p>
