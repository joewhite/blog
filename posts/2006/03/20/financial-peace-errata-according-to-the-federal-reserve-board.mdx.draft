<p>Someone in <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave</a>'s office is playing pretty fast and loose with statistics.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/home/">Financial Peace University</a> workbook, page 141 (no reference date given to tell us what "last year" means):</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>According to the Federal Reserve Board, consumers' outstanding debt on credit cards and other revolving loans has grown continuously over the last decade hitting $1.5 trillion last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess what? <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/Current/">According to the Federal Reserve Board</a>, that's a lie. Yes, <em>total</em> consumer debt did top $1.5 trillion in <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/20010108/">October of 2000</a>, but "credit cards and other revolving loans" only made up 43% of that &#8212; less than half. So no, "credit cards and other revolving loans" did <em>not</em> hit $1.5 trillion. Even today, with <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/Current/">total consumer debt over $2 trillion</a>, revolving debt is just barely over $800 billion, with a long way to go to even the $1 trillion mark.</p>
<p>I say that so casually, don't I? But man, the emotional impact, talking about that in class, would be huge. Talking about $1.5 trillion, and writing it out with <em>every... single... freaking... zero,</em> would make a hell of a lot bigger impression, I think, than talking about a mere $804 billion. If you're thinking about how to get teenagers worked up about debt, $804 billion might as well be $1 billion. (Hmm, but maybe I could do something with "three quarters of a trillion dollars" or some such...)</p>
<p>Ah well. I'm at least glad that I checked the facts before I took Dave at his word and used his statistic in class.</p>
