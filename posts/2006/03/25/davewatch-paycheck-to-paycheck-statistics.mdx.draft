<p>I was just listening to the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/radio/home/index.cfm?FuseAction=dspContent&amp;strMode=dspShowArchives">Dave Ramsey show</a> from this past Thursday. About fifteen minutes into the third hour, he said, "AC Nielsen just did a survey. It was in USA Today just the other day. 78% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck."</p>
<p>This is looking like another shady statistic on Dave's part. I couldn't find any reference to this study on the USA Today Web site (if anyone can find it, please let me know). There are statistics on AC Nielsen's Web site, but what it <em>actually</em> says is that <a href="http://us.acnielsen.com/news/20060124.shtml">22% of Americans have "no spare cash"</a> (January 24, 2006). The way I read it, that means that 78% are <em>not</em> living paycheck-to-paycheck.</p>
<p>I'm a little surprised; I would've thought the paycheck-to-paycheck number would be higher than that. But I'm really starting to wonder who does Dave's research.</p>
