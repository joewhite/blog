<p>I haven't blogged about how I'm going to the <a href="http://www.agile2006.com/">Agile 2006</a> conference this year. Shame on me.</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to the Agile 2006 conference this year. In fact, I'm already here, and so are <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/">Sam</a> and <a href="http://blog.briankohrs.com/">Brian</a>. I would've blogged earlier, but my (free) in-room Net connection wasn't working. But the switch is now reset, and I have net. Happy!</p>
<p>I plan to blog the con like I did for <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/tag/borcon2004/">previous</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/tag/borcon2005/">BorCons</a> (assuming the con has free wireless, which I certainly <em>hope</em> they will), so get on my case if I fall behind. (grin) I'll blog more later &#8212; we're about to head for registration, and then probably grab a bite before the afternoon session.</p>
