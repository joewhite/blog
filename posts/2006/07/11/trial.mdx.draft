<p>This just in: the Pentagon has finally acknowledged what the Founding Fathers already knew, <em>viz.,</em> that prisoners have a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,1818413,00.html">right to a court hearing</a>. And that includes political prisoners.</p>
<p>It's not clear how far-reaching the implications will be; the White House is already trying to downplay the news. But allow me to dream for a moment. Imagine a world where, when the secret police come and arrest you in the middle of the night, they can no longer hold you indefinitely, without evidence, on mere "suspicion" of "terrorism". A world where mistaken arrests can't be simply swept under the rug. (Have they been? Would we know if they had?) A world where the Inquisitors can't even torture a confession out of you, but actually have to prove your guilt in court.</p>
<p>Gee. Thinking about it that way, you'd almost think we lived in the Land of the Free.</p>
