<p><a href="http://www1.daveramsey.com/hope/events/index.cfm?FuseAction=dspContent&amp;intContentID=3423">Russ Carroll</a>, Dave's lead financial coach, is going to be <a href="https://www1.daveramsey.com/etc/ecommerce/index.cfm?intID=2,25&amp;P2XXevent_id=204&amp;strMode=liveevent">in Lincoln on August 12</a>&nbsp;doing a Dave Ramsey-branded <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/hope/events/">Live Event</a>, and Jennie and I are going to be there.</p>
<p>Not quite sure what it's going to be like, especially since we've already taken Financial Peace University. But I do know that one of the best things about FPU was being around other people who were in the same boat as us (and willing to admit it). So even if the content turns out to be a repeat, I think it'll be well spent.</p>
<p>And it's <em>cheap</em> as things like this go ($27 per person). If you live within a couple hours' drive, and if you've ever had, as Dave puts it, "too much month left at the end of the money", I've got two words for you: <strong><em>Go.</em></strong></p>
