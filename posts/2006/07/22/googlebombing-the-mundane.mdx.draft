<p>I wanted to know what time Oak View Mall opens today, since I want to do some shopping today. So I Googled for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=oak+view+mall+omaha+hours">oak view mall omaha hours</a>, and I looked at the results, and I thought, "You're kidding. You're telling me one of the biggest malls in Omaha doesn't have its own Web site?"</p>
<p>Then I scrolled, and there it was at #7. Still on the first page, but the mall apparently has a pretty poor Google rank. Somebody's AOL homepage is at #2, for crying out loud. That ain't right!</p>
<p>So, doing my part to increase the relevance of the Web, here's my mundane Google-bomb for <a href="http://www.oakviewmall.com/html/mallinfo.asp">mall hours for Oak View Mall in Omaha</a>. Pass the meme.</p>
