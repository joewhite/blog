<p>I love the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/">NaNo forums</a>. They're such a good way to avoid writing a novel.</p>
<p>They're also a good way to avoid sleeping, and get tips on novel-writing in the process. In a <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=10652&amp;forum=158">thread about outlining</a>, several people recommended the <a href="http://www.rsingermanson.com/html/the_snowflake.html">Snowflake Method</a>. It looks pretty intriguing: start with a one-sentence summary of your story, and then go through several more passes, adding more detail each time, until you've got a novel.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I'd try it this year, except that it's got several weeks worth of planning before you start writing your first draft, and I don't have several weeks between now and November. It's frightening enough to think that I have less than a week, and still no character sketch for the confidant or the romantic interest. (Still stuck trying to write Section Sheet 4.)</p>
<p>Maybe next year. Duly filed away in my blog for future reference.</p>
