<p>As you can probably tell from the word-count widget in my sidebar, I'm planning to do <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> again this year. (For any who haven't heard of it, that means I'm going to be writing a novel. In a month. Yes, I am insane, thanks for asking.)</p>
<p>My first NaNo novel ("<a href="http://www.excastle.com/vulcanviking/NaNo2002/">The Littlest Evil Overlord</a>") was humorous fantasy, and was decent (for a novel written in a month). The second one ("<a href="http://www.excastle.com/vulcanviking/NaNo2003/">Here Be Dragons</a>") was somewhat darker urban fantasy, and it sucked. In retrospect, and having read a few more books about writing, I think that a big reason for this is that I don't <em>read</em> urban fantasy. I read humorous fantasy, like Discworld novels. So that's what I'm going to write this year.</p>
<p>The NaNo rules allow you to put together as much of a plot outline as you want before the beginning of November (though <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/xoopsfaq/index.php?cat_id=13#28">actual prose is punishable by death</a>), so I'm diligently working on my outline every now and then. I figure I've already done the "make it up as you go" thing in previous years, so this time I'll try "plan ahead" and see how I like it.</p>
<p>This year's topic: Pirates.</p>
<p>Pirate monks, to be exact.</p>
<p>(I mean, think about it; it makes sense. Back before the printing press, what did monks do with their time? They copied books. Illuminated Bibles and all that. So what do they do now? They copy music. Pirates, arr. Sailing under the skull and cross.)</p>
<p>Of course, there are also going to be the evil pirate ninjas. And the princess who just dyed her hair purple. And you know there's gotta be a dragon in there <em>somewhere.</em></p>
<p>I will not, however, be putting my novel on the public Web this year. I'm toying with the idea of trying to get it published for money if it doesn't suck too bad (denial springs eternal), and that means not "publishing" it online first. But that doesn't mean I can't share it with a few people. So if you're curious about what the hell I'll be coming up with, drop me a line via my <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/contact/">contact form</a>. I'll be writing the novel on <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, which makes it easy to share a document with a group of people. Come One! Come All! ...well, okay, not all; "not all" is kinda the point.</p>
<p>So reserve your place in line. See a legend in the making.</p>
<p>Okay, enough procrastinating. Back to the character sketches...</p>
