<p>I discovered <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/">El Goonish Shive</a> over the weekend. It's a webcomic featuring an alien-hybrid were-squirrel, women with giant hammers, anime-style martial arts, and a gender-bending transformation gun. And also <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/d/20020422.html">a demonic duck of some sort</a>, which I just may have to feature in my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNo</a> novel this year. (The "<a href="http://www.egscomics.com/d/20060102.html">Duck senses... tingling!</a>" strip just about made me fall off my chair.)</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/newbie.html">New Reader Guide</a>, which is probably a fine place to start reading. The site is a bit confusing, as there are three separate archives: <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/">EGS</a> (the main comic), <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/">EGS:NP</a> (off-topic stuff), and <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/Filler/">FILLER</a> (other off-topic stuff). They mostly have the same characters, but the main strip has the most continuity. The best place to start (after the New Reader Guide) is with <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/d/20020121.html">the first EGS strip</a>. Be warned that it will take a while to dig through the archives, as the strip started in 2002 and was daily for a while.</p>
<p>Go. Enjoy. And if you don't happen to like it, then... hey, is that a demonic duck of some sort?</p>
