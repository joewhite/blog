<p>Not bad. 2,401 words in my first day, with 1,841 of them in the first hour and a half of NaNo. And today was a youth-group night, on a night when I also had a meeting <em>before</em> youth group. Plus the time I spent chasing my e-mail problems.</p>
<p>Now, if I can just crank out enough words to make up for not being at a computer all weekend...</p>
