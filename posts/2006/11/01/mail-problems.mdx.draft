<p>Apparently some of my excastle.com e-mail has been bouncing for the past week or so. I've asked support to look into the problems, but in the meantime, I've changed the settings so that blog-related mail now bypasses the server that's been having problems. So if you've sent me something via my Contact form recently, and haven't heard back, please try it again.</p>
<p>Note: this does not apply to the dweebs who think my purpose in life is to e-mail them printer drivers. Those people I would ask to <em>not</em> try again.</p>
