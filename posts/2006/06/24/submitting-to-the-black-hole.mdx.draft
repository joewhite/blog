<p>There's a Web site that reports how long science-fiction authors have had to wait for responses from various publishers. It's called "<a href="http://www.critique.org/users/critters/blackholes/sightdata.html">Submitting to the Black Hole</a>".</p>
<p>Some people had to wait more than a year <em>just to get a response.</em> And some are still waiting.</p>
<p>Depressing.</p>
<p>Then again, some got a response in a matter of weeks, or even days (though the averages aren't usually quite that good). So if/when I'm ready to submit something new for publication, I think I'll be spending some quality time with this list.</p>
