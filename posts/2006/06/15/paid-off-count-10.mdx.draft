<p>Paid off GSB this morning. We've been planning it since we made the budget late last month. Our second-draft budget was tantalizingly close, and we decided to stretch and skim and make it work. Tightened the grocery budget, put off a couple things, and go.</p>
<p>I'm glad we did. That receipt with "Balance Due: 0" really makes me happy. Another one bites the dust.</p>
