<p>It's interesting how often I run into <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2006/04/02/agile-cash/#4816">the idea that you need a credit card to rent a car</a>. It's particularly interesting because it isn't particularly true.</p>
<p>Relevant quote:</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>"Be sure you check ahead in advance, but I fly all over America and rent cars every week, virtually, I am appearing somewhere, speaking somewhere, doing something. I simply reach into my pocket, pull out one of my two Visa debit cards, on my personal account or on my business, and I can rent a car anywhere except a couple of the majors, and I don't don't do business with them anyway &#8212; they are too expensive." &#8212; <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey</a>, in the "Dumping Debt" session of <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/home/">Financial Peace University</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I can vouch for this, too. I've rented one car from <a href="http://www.rentawreck.com/">Rent-A-Wreck</a> and several cars from <a href="http://www.enterprise.com/">Enterprise</a> using Visa check cards (aka debit cards).



So the money comes straight out of my checking account, with none of that "<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2006/04/02/agile-cash/">I promise I'll pay it later</a>" nonsense.</p>
<p>Warning, though: I was talking to someone a couple weeks ago who said their car died in the middle of nowhere, and they tried to rent a car from the local Enterprise office, which <em>wouldn't</em> take their check card. So it may be a regional thing. Be sure to call ahead and check.</p>
<p>Also from my personal experience, when I tried to rent from <a href="http://www.budget.com/">Budget Rent-A-Car</a> a few years ago, they said they didn't accept check cards. Which kind of sucked, because they didn't bother to tell me this when I placed my reservation; I didn't find out until I got to the counter to pick up the car, with all my other travel arrangements already booked and non-refundable. I wasn't too happy that day.</p>
<p>Moral: do be sure to specifically ask, ahead of time (this is important), whether the rental agency accepts the Visa check card. But I've rented cars on several occasions with non-debt-bearing plastic. Check with the rental agencies in your town; chances are, you'll find one less reason to keep a credit card.</p>
