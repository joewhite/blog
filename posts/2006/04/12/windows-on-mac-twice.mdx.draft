<p>So not only can you <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">dual-boot a Mac</a> into Windows XP, there's now a VMWare-ish app called <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> that will run any version of Windows (or whatever), in a window, on a Mac, and it's even supposed to be pretty fast. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/technology/13pogue.html">has some pretty good things to say</a> about it, and it's firmly in the consumer price range ($40 pre-order, $50 when it ships).</p>
<p>If I had a Mac, the Parallels beta is definitely a toy I'd be playing with.</p>
