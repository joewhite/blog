<p><a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/">wiki.ehow.com</a> is a pretty cool site. I first found it when I was looking for instructions on <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_13874_peel-mince-garlic.html">how to mince garlic</a>. They're one of the RSS feeds on my Google homepage now.</p>
<p>One of the latest is "<a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/Develop-Your-Personal-Elevator-Pitch">How to Develop Your Personal Elevator Pitch</a>". They don't explain what they mean by "elevator pitch", but I've heard the term before (though I heard it called "elevator speech"). One of my former bosses had started three different companies, and was pretty good at getting investor money, so he was well-versed in elevator speaking.</p>
<p>The idea is, you've just gotten onto an elevator with someone, and they say, "So, what do you do?" Your time limit: you have until the elevator stops. You're not giving your life story, you're just trying to get their interest so you can have them remember you, and give them a business card. You seldom give an elevator speech in an actual elevator, but the name gives the flavor of it: it's a speech for any situation (and they are legion) where you have a very limited time to get to the point and get the other person's interest.</p>
<p>The eHow elevator-pitch article isn't about elevator speeches in general (though it has some good tips). It's specifically targeted to job interviews, and having a prepared answer to the interview question, "Tell me about yourself." If you're on a job search, this article is definitely worth a read.</p>
