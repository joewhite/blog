<p>One of the things <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave</a> does on his show is to have people call in and, on the air, cut up or otherwise destroy their credit cards. Creative means of destruction are encouraged, but anything will do: scissors, shredders, firearms, whatever.</p>
<p>Some friends recently loaned us the first season of <a href="http://rdanderson.com/macgyver/macgyver.htm">MacGyver</a> on DVD, and I think MacGyver set a new standard when he used his Swiss army knife to slice up a credit card to jam a traffic light so he could get out of the country.</p>
<p>My kind of guy.</p>
