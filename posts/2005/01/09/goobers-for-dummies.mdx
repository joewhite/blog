sort: 2096

<p>I've decided to start a new series of nonfiction books. They'll be similar to the "For Dummies" and "Complete Idiot's Guide" books, but these will be "For The Complete Goober". Each one will feature a picture of our youngest cat, Monkey, more affectionately (?) known as <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/12/10/particle-physics/">Goober</a>.</p>
<p>If someone had invented an instant-replay for real life with still-frame-capture option, we would already have all the cover art we would ever need.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Finance for the Complete Goober:</strong> Checkbook balancing, budgeting, document-gnawing, and sticking your stinky butt in people's faces when they try to pay bills. Cover photo: picture of Monkey lying on top of the checkbook, gnawing on Jennie's pen, with his tail knocking the stack of bills off the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Bartending for the Complete Goober:</strong> Mixed drinks, shots, and bathroom faucets. Cover photo: picture of Monkey sitting on the edge of the bathtub, his paws wrapped around the water faucet, hanging half-upside-down from said faucet, trying to catch the drips, while the shower is running. Bonus back-cover photo: Monkey with a punk hairdo.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking for the Complete Goober:</strong> Simple dishes, food-handling tips, and advice on when it's better to jump on top of the stove vs. flopping around on the floor biting people's ankles. Cover photo: picture of Jennie bent down to get a pizza out of the oven, <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/08/catymology/">with Monkey standing on her back</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gardening for the Complete Goober:</strong> Perennials, biennials, and gnaw-ennials, featuring advice on exactly how much of the plant you can eat without getting locked in the bathroom. Cover photo: picture of Monkey, curled up inside a large pot, lying on top of a bag of potting soil.</p>
<p><strong>Jogging for the Complete Goober:</strong> Tips for staying cool, how to hit your target heart rate, and how to obtain maximum complaining volume when Mom is carrying you the half-mile back home in a pillowcase. Cover photo: time-lapse photo of a monkey-colored blur crossing the street and tearing through the park, with a Jennie-colored blur (carrying a pillowcase) in hot pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>Package Delivery for the Complete Goober:</strong> Overview of different carriers, insurance options, etc., along with instructions on how to escape from the house so you can steal the UPS truck. Cover photo: picture of Monkey sitting behind the steering wheel of the UPS truck, trying to find the ignition.</p>
