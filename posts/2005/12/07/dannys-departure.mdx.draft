<p>Marco Cant&#249; <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/goodluckdanny.html">reported some sad news</a> yesterday: <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/dcc/">Danny Thorpe</a> has left Borland.</p>
<p>(Looks like it's not just a rumor &#8212; <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/johnk/">John Kaster</a>&nbsp;posted <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/borland.public.delphi.non-technical/browse_frm/thread/1c33d1760c80fcf/a5ec03aacfe97019?lnk=st&amp;rnum=1#a5ec03aacfe97019">this</a> on the newsgroups, which is enough confirmation for me.)</p>
<p>On the plus side, Danny's new job is at Google, and it sounds like he'll mostly be working on the FireFox browser &#8212; so we can certainly expect some even better things from FireFox in the future. (There have been rumors of FireFox extensions written in Delphi...)</p>
<p>So long, Danny, and thanks for all the tea leaves. Good luck &#8212; and, on a slightly selfish note, I hope we'll all benefit from your new job as much as we did from your old one.</p>
