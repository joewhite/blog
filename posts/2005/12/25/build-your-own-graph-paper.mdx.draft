A friend pointed out a Web site that lets you <a href="http://incompetech.com/beta/plainGraphPaper/">generate your own graph paper</a>&nbsp;(along with a few other things that aren't exactly graph paper). You fill out a Web form and it comes back with a customized PDF. You can do grids, grids with heavy lines every inch and medium lines every half inch (configurable, of course), hex paper, dots (grid and hex), asymmetric grids, staves for sheet music, plain old lined paper, and a few other things I've never even heard of (tumbling blocks, anyone?). You can also set the number of lines per inch (or centimeter) and the color of the grid lines. And it's free. Pretty sweet.
