<p>I finally got Jennie to an FPU class last Sunday (once she actually got there, she loved it). We finished this month's budget this Tuesday (with per-paycheck breakout this time &#8212; and without spending more than we make, aside from a "loan" from our checking balance that we'll pay back before the month is out). And last night I survived my first OWL event (the parent meeting).</p>
<p>So I'm pretty tired right now. Only one more day till the weekend...</p>
