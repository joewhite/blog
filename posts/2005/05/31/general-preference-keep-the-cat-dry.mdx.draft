<p>I was supposed to take Tycho to the vet this evening, for another re-check on his eye. But after driving home from work, I decided against it. It's raining a bit (sarcasm), and I decided I didn't really want to drive my crabbiest child to the vet, during a thunderstorm, through 84th Street Lake.</p>
<p>Our regular vet will be in Thursday morning; we'll go then. (hastily checks weather forecast) Yeah, we'll go then.</p>
