<p>So I showed up for the morris-dance session this evening, only to find out that it hadn't panned out for this evening; for a variety of reasons, most of the members didn't show up, so they called it off. I was kind of looking forward to trying something new. Oh well.</p>
<p>Actually, I won't have any lack of new somethings to try this week &#8212; tomorrow I'm playing substitute, and helping lead the 9th-grade OWL class. I have to admit, I'm very interested in what goes on in that 9th-grade curriculum, not having been a Unitarian yet when I was in 9th grade. And I've really enjoyed our adult OWL classes. But I'm still a bit intimidated by the thought of spending an hour and a half, talking to some very smart, very spirited ninth-graders, many of whom have been Unitarians all their lives, about sexuality.</p>
<p>It should be quite the experience. Especially since the topic for tomorrow will be "options for unwanted pregnancy". I've already been warned that, even though it's far from the only topic on the agenda, we'll spend a good chunk of time talking about abortion. Whew. I'm going <em>straight</em> off the deep end on this one!</p>
