<p>This is probably going to show up as being posted on May 15th, but that's only because my blog's clock is screwed up somehow.</p>
<p>So anyway, yesterday (or today, if you believe my blog's timestamp) marks the one-year anniversary of this blog. Can you believe it started out as just a place for me to <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/05/15/systemcomponentmodel/">save my bookmarks</a>?</p>
<p>Happy birthday, blog!</p>
