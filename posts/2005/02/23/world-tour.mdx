<p>I was listening to the radio in the car this morning, on the way back from the gym. The Radio Personalities were telling us about the news that they were <em>going</em> to tell us about After This Important Message From Our Sponsor. One of the items was an update on President Bush's "world tour".</p>
<p>That just so reminded me of <a href="http://www.northernsun.com/cgi-bin/ns/1618MT.html">this</a>.</p>
