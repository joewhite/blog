<p>Three weeks ago, I did some hacking on my blog software. Never mind that I don't have the source code for the version I'm running.</p>
<p>And it's been pretty darned nice: since that hacking session, not a single spam comment has gotten through.</p>
<p>(And no, I didn't get that by disabling comments.)</p>
<p>Comment spammers are so unimaginative that a hamster could be trained to block them. And so far, my hamster is doing quite well indeed.</p>
<p>If you ever try to post a comment on my blog, and if the hamster politely asks you to "please go away, you filthy spammer", and if furthermore you are <em>not</em> a filthy spammer, please click my Contact link and drop me a note, and let me know everything about your comment (Title, Name, URL, and Comments), and the hamster and I will have a little chat. But, with that said, I don't think it's too likely to happen. My hamster is pretty smart.</p>
