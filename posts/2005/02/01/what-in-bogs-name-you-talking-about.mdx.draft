<p>Brad <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/01/31/ah-teeth/#702">asked about the Bog reference</a>. It comes from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312863551/ref=lpr_g_2/002-2516500-6329660?v=glance&amp;s=books">Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a>", an excellent book by Robert Heinlein (probably the best Heinlein book I've read so far). In the book, most of the characters, when they make any reference to a deity, refer to it as "Bog". Amazon was kind enough to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312863551/ref=sib_aps_ref/002-2516500-6329660?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=%22moon%20is%20a%20harsh%20mistress%22%20bog&amp;v=search-inside">provide</a> a few Bog-related quotes from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn't want Shorty, Bog rest his generous soul, to haunt me."</p>
<p>"Mike, for Bog's sake! Blown all circuits?"</p>
<p>"What in Bog's name you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <em>Bog!"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hence my "Bog be praised!" in my <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/01/31/ah-teeth/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>I like using "Bog" partly because it doesn't immediately suggest any particular religion, and partly because of the funny looks I get when I use it. (grin)</p>
