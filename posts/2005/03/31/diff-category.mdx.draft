<p>I've created a new <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/tag/diff/">Diff category</a>&nbsp;on my blog, for my articles about the diff algorithm and (hopefully, later) source code.</p>
<p>And for my <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/03/29/diff-part-3-introducing-the-longest-common-subsequence/#793">junkies</a>&nbsp;(grin), I'm hoping to get another diff article out tonight.</p>
