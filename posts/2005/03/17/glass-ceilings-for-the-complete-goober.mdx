<p>We bought a used kitchen table a few weeks ago. It's got a glass top.</p>
<p>This made for some entertaining viewing, because Noel climbed up on top of the table, lay down, and made herself comfortable. And <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/01/09/goobers-for-dummies/">Goober</a>, who likes to harass Noel for as many of his waking hours as he can without getting distracted, spent a good forty-five minutes pacing around under the table, trying to figure out how to attack her.</p>
<p>Our kitchen table has more paw prints on the bottom than it does on the top. We get built-in amusement with our breakfast... all we need to do is put Noel on the table and wait. It's not just a table, it's an entertainment center!</p>
