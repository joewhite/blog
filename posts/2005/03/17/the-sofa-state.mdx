<p>From the first time I saw this picture in the newspaper, back when it was still one of several proposed designs...</p>

<p>I thought, "Why is there a sofa at the bottom of the license plate?"</p>
<p>(As I later found out, it's actually supposed to be a covered wagon. But it still looks like a sofa to me.)</p>
<p>When Jennie and I were in the car yesterday, we happened to pull up to a stop behind a car with one of these new plates, and I made some comment about living in "the sofa state".</p>
<p>Jennie had heard (and shared) my opinions about the sofa before, but she still laughed. She said, "I still don't understand what a couch has to do with Nebraska."</p>
<p>I shrugged, and said, "It must be because of <a href="http://www.nfm.com/">Nebraska Furniture Mart</a>." It took her a while to stop laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska: the Nebraska Furniture Mart state.</strong></p>
<p>Now, won't that look nice in the history books?</p>
