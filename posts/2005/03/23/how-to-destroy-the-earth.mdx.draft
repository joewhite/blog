Wow. This ranks right up there with <a href="http://www.pixelscapes.com/spatulacity/button.htm">TRBBTDDA</a>, <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/">strawberry Pop-Tart blowtorches</a>, and <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">the Evil Overlord list</a>.



An excerpt from the Preamble of <a href="http://ned.ucam.org/~sdh31/misc/destroy.html">How to destroy the Earth</a>:
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px">Destroying the Earth is harder than you may have been led to believe.

You've seen the action movies where the bad guy threatens to destroy the Earth. You've heard people on the news claiming that the next nuclear war or cutting down rainforests or persisting in releasing hideous quantities of pollution into the atmosphere threatens to end the world.

Fools.

The Earth was built to last. It is a 4,550,000,000-year-old, 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000-tonne ball of iron. It has taken more devastating asteroid hits in its lifetime than you've had hot dinners, and lo, it still orbits merrily. So my first piece of advice to you, dear would-be Earth-destroyer, is: do NOT think this will be easy.</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure you've got plenty of time. This thing is <em>amazingly</em> detailed, and extremely amusing. (I laughed out loud more than once. If you know me, you know that's something.)</p>
