<p>I'm stunned.</p>
<p>I'll start from the beginning. Somebody named Ooogabooga sent me a weird e-mail message a few hours ago. It said, and I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your performance at the Kirksville K-Life House blew completely, nerd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know what a Kirksville K-Life House was, so I googled and dug a bit. What I found is that <a href="http://www.klife.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">K-Life Ministries</a> is a Christian youth ministry organization; that they have a chapter in <a href="http://www.klife.com/where/kirksville.html" rel="nofollow">Kirksville, MO</a>; and that yesterday (Saturday) night, that chapter had an event called "PURE EXCITEMENT", led by somebody named Joe White.</p>



<p>I actually know who this other Joe White is, in a vague way. Several years ago, I briefly joined a Baptist men's group (obviously this was before I discovered the Unitarians), and one night they showed a video of a <a href="http://www.promisekeepers.org/" rel="nofollow">Promise Keepers</a> event, where this <a href="http://www.promisekeepers.org/confbios223" rel="nofollow">Joe White</a> character was speaking. I watched the video, and then forgot about him for a while.</p>
<p>Much later, I started blogging, and after a while of that, I started to get curious about my blog's Google rank. And found that I had to go through many pages of this other Joe White before getting to me. (Actually, we were both pretty buried by some country singer named <a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Martin.Doppelbauer/main.htm" rel="nofollow">Tony Joe White</a>.)</p>
<p>The guy I saw on the Promise Keepers video a few years ago is the same guy who ran the K-Life session last night. So. Mystery solved: mistaken identity. Ooogabooga went looking for this other Joe White, stumbled onto me instead, and called the wrong guy a nerd.</p>
<p>I almost left it there. But then a little thought wandered into my head. And that little thought was, "I wonder why he found my Web site instead of this other guy's."</p>
<p>And on a whim, I did a new Google search on my name; something I haven't done in a couple of months. And this is where the stunned part comes in.</p>
<p>I'm a guy with a blog. I don't run my own business. I've never spoken at a conference. I've <a href="http://www.excastle.com/vulcanviking/">written two novels</a>, neither published, both still in rough draft form.</p>
<p>This other Joe White runs a set of <a href="http://www.kanakuk.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian summer camps</a> that draw 20,000 kids every year. He spoke in front of 10,000 people at a <a href="http://www.promisekeepers.org/confvenu214" rel="nofollow">Promise Keepers convention</a> last year. He's published 13 books.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Joe+White&amp;btnG=Google+Search">On a Google search for our name</a>, he first shows up at result #10.</p>
<p>My blog is result #2.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
