Got a headache, got a headache,\
Got a headache just now,\
Just now I've got a headache,\
Got a headache just now.

It was rotten, it was rotten,\
It was rotten just now,\
Just now, it was rotten,\
It was rotten just now.

Excedrin, Excedrin,\
Excedrin just now,\
Just now, Excedrin,\
Excedrin just now.

Didn't help much, didn't help much,\
Didn't help much just now,\
Just now it didn't help much,\
Didn't help much just now.

Going to bed, going to bed,\
Going to bed just now,\
Just now I'm going to bed,\
Going to bed just now.

Thank you, you've been a great crowd. I'll be here all week.

(Hey, I get euphoric when the Excedrin starts to kick in. Whether it's the caffeine, or something to do with the migraine itself, I don't know... but I'll spare you any more silliness by going to bed, just now.)
