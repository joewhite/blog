<p>So what's the idea behind cat litter with <em>perfume</em> in it? I picked some up by mistake months ago, and still have most of it left, 'cause it makes the litterbox smell worse than before I changed it. Maybe it's just me, but I don't really want my cats' butts to smell like some little old lady's idea of appropriate <em>(cough)</em> fragrance <em>(wheeze)</em> for Sunday morning Baptist church service <em>(gag)</em>. Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
