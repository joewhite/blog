Continuing in the <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/tag/diff/">diff series</a>:

It's been a long time since Friday, so let's start by reviewing some of the problems with the "<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/08/diff-part-10-try-em-all-2-of-2/">try 'em all</a>" approach to <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/03/29/diff-part-3-introducing-the-longest-common-subsequence/">LCS</a> that we looked at last time. Here's our sample input again:
<blockquote><font face="Courier New">A is (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
B is (6 7 3 4 5 1 2)
</font>Matches are <font face="Courier New">[0,5]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[1,6]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[2,2]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[3,3]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[4,4]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[5,0]</font>, and <font face="Courier New">[6,1]</font>.</blockquote>
Trying every possible match string will take a ridiculous amount of time, because it wastes its time a couple of different ways:
<ul>
	<li>Obvious gaps: It tries <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/01/diff-part-5-match-strings/">match strings</a> like <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [4,4]</font> and <font face="Courier New">[3,3]</font>. That's bad &mdash; we want something that can recognize patterns a little better, and just try <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font> without trying variants with gaps (since there are a <em>lot</em> of variants with gaps).</li>
	<li>Invalid: It tries match strings like <font face="Courier New">[0,4] [2,2]</font> that aren't going to pass our <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/02/diff-part-6-match-strings-and-common-subsequences/">rule</a>. That's not so bad, but it would also try <font face="Courier New">[0,4] [2,2] [3,3]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[0,4] [2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>, etc., instead of cutting its losses as soon as it notices that no valid common subsequence will ever contain <font face="Courier New">[0,4] [2,2]</font>.</li>
</ul>
There are really only three match strings &mdash; out of a possible <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/07/diff-part-9-try-em-all-1-of-2/">325</a> (<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/08/diff-part-10-try-em-all-2-of-2/">31</a> if we can impose ordering on our matches, though we haven't actually worked out a way to do that yet) &mdash; that make any sense: <font face="Courier New">[0,4] [1,5]</font>; <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>; and <font face="Courier New">[5,0] [6,1]</font>. We want to ignore the other 322 (28) possibilities, and go straight to the good stuff. How do we do that?

Actually, we've gotten pretty close to that already, in our "<a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/05/diff-part-7-string-em-all-together-1-of-2/">string 'em all together</a>" algorithm. I made a big deal out of how it <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/06/diff-part-8-string-em-all-together-2-of-2/">didn't work</a>, but most of that came down to the fact that we only gave it one register; it could only keep track of one "best-yet common subsequence" at a time. If it had a list instead, it would be a pretty decent fit. Let's run through the way it would work.
<ul>
	<li>We start with the first match, <font face="Courier New">[0,5]</font>. That's the only match we've looked at so far, so we have one common subsequence (CS) at this point: <font face="Courier New">[0,5]</font>.</li>
	<li>The next match is <font face="Courier New">[1,6]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5]</font> and still have a valid CS? We would end up with <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>, which passes our <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/02/diff-part-6-match-strings-and-common-subsequences/">rule</a>, so yes, we can append it. Our CS is now <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>.</li>
	<li>Next: <font face="Courier New">[2,2]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font> and still have a valid CS? We would end up with <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6] [2,2]</font>, which fails our <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/02/diff-part-6-match-strings-and-common-subsequences/">rule</a>, so no, we can't append it to our existing CS. But we don't want to throw the <font face="Courier New">[2,2]</font> away, so let's add it to our list. Now we have two CSes going: <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font> and <font face="Courier New">[2,2]</font>.</li>
	<li>Next: <font face="Courier New">[3,3]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>? No. What about <font face="Courier New">[2,2]</font>? Yes. Our CSes are now <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font> and <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3]</font>.</li>
	<li>Next: <font face="Courier New">[4,4]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>? No. What about <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3]</font>? Yes. Our CSes are now <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font> and <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>.</li>
	<li>Next: <font face="Courier New">[5,0]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>? No. What about <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>? No, so we'll have to start another CS. Our CSes are now <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>, and <font face="Courier New">[5,0]</font>.</li>
	<li>Next: <font face="Courier New">[6,1]</font>. Can we tack that onto <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>? No. What about <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>? No. <font face="Courier New">[5,0]</font>? Yes. Our CSes are now <font face="Courier New">[0,5] [1,6]</font>, <font face="Courier New">[2,2] [3,3] [4,4]</font>, and <font face="Courier New">[5,0] [6,1]</font>.</li>
</ul>
Three sensible CSes, and one is longer than the others. So that's our LCS. And it does, in fact, match what we expected.

This still won't quite work for all inputs. I'll refine it a bit more next time.
