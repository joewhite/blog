<p>For your reading amusement: <a href="http://www.ontruth.com/uua.html" rel="nofollow">Unpacking Unitarian Universalism</a>.</p>
<p>Warning: If you're a UU, you may want to make sure you've taken your blood-pressure medication before you read this. It's a page telling Christians &#8212; Southern Baptists in particular &#8212; how to bring Unitarian Universalists to Jesus.</p>
<p>They do admit, though, that "By any standard, Unitarian-Universalists are a hard people to win to Jesus. You might even say that they are impossible to win, but with God all things are indeed possible."</p>
<p>Indeed. All things <em>are</em> possible. Including the rejection of any religion that believes it's got a monopoly on truth.</p>
