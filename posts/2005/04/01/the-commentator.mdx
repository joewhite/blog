My dad sent me an interesting link this morning, for a development tool called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050406004253/http://www.cenqua.com/commentator/">The Commentator</a>. Some of their marketspeak (emphasis theirs):

> The Commentator uses revolutionary real-time language processing to **actually grok your code** and **add the necessary comments on the fly.**

> The Commentator's powerful Personality Controls allow you to tweak it's output so completely that it's as if The Commentator is **speaking for you.** In your voice.

Their tagline sums it up: "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050406004253/http://www.cenqua.com/commentator/">Time commenting could be time coding.</a>"

Check it out. The example comments are quite illuminating.
