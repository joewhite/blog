<p>We've had some beautiful weather lately, so last night I pumped up our bike tires, intending to go for a ride. And then I didn't do it. Ah well.</p>
<p>I got out this morning, after getting the dust cleaned out of my helmet. I made it all the way around the block. It's a largish block, with a hill. I've ridden up worse hills before, but I was in shape then.</p>
<p>Coasting down the hill was easy. I made it about 2/3 of the way back up before I had to get off and walk. At the time, I debated pedaling a little farther, but I'm glad I didn't; I was puffing something fierce by the time I got back home. I'm now happily collapsed into my chair and debating how long I can lie here before I have to get back up and go to work. I've got some vacation days saved up, don't I?</p>
<p>Lesson learned #1: Next time, I will take the garage door opener with me, so I don't have to park my bike, climb up the outside stairs, unlock the front door, go inside, and then go back down the stairs to open the garage. Save myself a little extra exertion.</p>
<p>Lesson learned #2: Next time, I will pour the glass of Gatorade before I leave, so it's ready when I get back.</p>
