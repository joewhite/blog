<p>My <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/04/15/ants-in-the-kitchen/">homemade remedy</a> didn't last long. The ants got back into the kitchen Friday while I was at work.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, I spent about fifteen minutes outside, antwatching. Trying to figure out where their anthill was. I never did quite find it, but I figured out the general area, and started spraying (with the bug spray that the previous owners didn't take with them when they moved out).</p>
<p>Wow, it worked. That particular ant colony now consists only of the few ants that were already in the kitchen, and never quite managed to find their way back out through the dish-soap gauntlet. I saw (and smushed) one straggler this afternoon, and otherwise none since yesterday.</p>
<p>Man (or rather, man's consumer chemical industry) triumphs versus insect. It's a small victory, but hey, you take what you can get.</p>
