<p>Wow, I'm getting behind in my blogging.</p>
<p>For anyone who might care, I'm going to BorCon next week (though I guess they're calling it DevCon this year). I'm not sure who was in charge of scheduling it this time around; the Tuesday-through-Thursday schedule is pretty bizarre. But I'm flying out on Sunday, and on Monday I'm taking a couple of preconference tutorials, including Danny's "Reading Tea Leaves" session. Deep voodoo debugging, from a compiler hacker. You can bet I'll be blogging <em>then.</em></p>
