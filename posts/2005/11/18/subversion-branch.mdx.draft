<p>We did a branch in Subversion today.</p>
<p>It was great. We didn't have to wait around for hours for it to finish. We didn't have to tell everyone to stay out of VSS until further notice. We didn't discover that the repository was corrupted and have to run a repair that took all day.</p>
<p>We just did the branch. It took maybe a second or two.</p>
<p>Subversion rocks.</p>
