<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Anybody remember a <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/15/disavowal/">little</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/24/disavowal-disavowal-annotated/">flap</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/borland.public.delphi.non-technical/browse_thread/thread/f2257b037567d311/0e32938f613627cb?lnk=st&q=%22joe+white%22+delphi+license&rnum=3#0e32938f613627cb">last</a> <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,32717,00.html">year</a>, over the beta license agreement for Diamondback?</p>
<p>Well, apparently nobody at Borland remembers it, because nobody actually fixed it. From section 6 of this year's beta license agreement:</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>6. CONFIDENTIALITY. You acknowledge that the Product including its existence and features, and related information remains a confidential trade secret of Borland. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2004/09/24/disavowal-disavowal-annotated/">Look familiar</a>?</p>
<p>Now, you know I'm going to install it anyway; you know us geeks and our toys. But think I'm allowed to be a little grumpy about it. Didn't they fix this once already?</p>
<p>So anyway. By the time you read this, I will grumpily deny that I know anything about a new version of Delphi that might or might not be coming out. I don't know anything about <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/reading-tea-leaves-the-fine-art-of-debugging/">all</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/borcon-2005-start-of-day-one/">this</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/opening-keynote/">stuff</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/keynote-continued/">I've</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/whats-new-in-delphi/">been</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/whats-new-in-the-delphi-compiler/">blogging</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/whats-new-in-eco-iii/">about</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/using-together-in-delphi/">since</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/10/miscellaneous-conference-catch-up-stuff/">the conference</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/10/beta/">started</a>. As far as I know, Borland isn't coming out with another version of Delphi this year. And no, that isn't a DVD in my pocket; I'm just happy to see you.</p>
<p>In fact, I have no idea why I just wrote this post. I don't know anything about it.</p>
<p>(Unless, by chance, Mr. Swindell wants to fix it again...)</p>
