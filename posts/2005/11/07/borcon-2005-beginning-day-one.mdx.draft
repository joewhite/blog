<p>Got into San Francisco last night. All went well, although it was a bit frustrating to be on a 3.5 hour flight with a laptop with a 1.5 hour battery. Had a bit of trouble finding outlets in the hotel room, too; wound up plugging it in in the bathroom to charge overnight. I'm in luck this morning, though; I found a seat right next to an outlet.</p>
<p>Added bonus: in all the preconference tutorial rooms, they've got an empty glass at each seat and a pitcher of ice water on each table. Cool. I hope that'll extend to the rest of the con.</p>
<p>This morning I'm sitting in on the Agile and XP session, and this afternoon, of course, is Danny's session on deep-voodoo debugging. Further updates as circumstances warrant.</p>
