<p><a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/">Sam</a> passed along a link to <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html">an article called "Tact Filters"</a> a few days ago. (He, in turn, got it from <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Ron</a>.) It's about some of the differences between nerds/geeks and everyone else, and in particular, why everyone gets frustrated when geeks try to talk to non-geeks.</p>
<p>It's short and sweet, and well worth the read whether you're a geek or not. As Sam said in his e-mail, "Now I understand me."</p>
