<p>Ancient Chinese curse: "May you live in interesting times."</p>
<p>I got a bit of a sunburn on Thursday. That's because I was standing around outside for about two hours in the early afternoon, with no sunscreen. And <em>that</em> is because I was waiting for a tow truck, and for a ride back to work, and for a call back from the insurance company, and for a call back from the car-rental company, and for the cop to finish writing out the ticket.</p>
<p>Yeah. I wrecked our remaining drivable car. (Jennie already <a href="http://jennie.excastle.com/2005/06/30/voices-of-reason/">blogged all about it</a>.)</p>
<p>When you're a dork like me, it's good to have friends who will help bail you out. Thanks, <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/">Sam</a> and <a href="http://www.sperari.com/">Erica</a>, for coming out to administer taxi service, hugs, chocolate, and assorted other remedies. And a sort of preemptive gratitude to everyone in my department, 'cause I know that anyone on the team probably would've dropped what they were doing to come rescue us. (Heck, the first two months I lived in Omaha, I didn't have a car, but getting to work was never a problem. "Team" kind of took on a new meaning when I started working here.)</p>
<p>I don't think about my friends often enough. It shouldn't take a car wreck to remind me. (There I go being a dork again.)</p>
