<p>We've been working toward a deadline at work, and a couple of weeks ago, our boss brought in a big cooler, which he's been keeping pretty well stocked with caffeinated beverages. Among them are various diet breeds, and today some of us got into a discussion of them, particularly Pepsi One and its kid brother, Coke Zero.</p>
<p>The most amusing comment of the afternoon was that hey, now that we've got both one and zero, we could build a computer that was powered entirely by Coke and Pepsi.</p>
