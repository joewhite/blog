No, I'm not making this up. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoCrqkQfJ5E">More</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxMPCaKcxpQ">footage</a>.

Despite what some articles are saying, criminal charges will not be filed. The signs are owned by a private company, not by the city, so that company would have to press charges; and the owner said, "<a href="http://io9.com/5142117/hackers-warn-texas-of-coming-zombie-war">It's Austin. We have a sense of humor. Let it go.</a>"

Too funny.

And before you ask, I was nowhere near Austin this weekend.
