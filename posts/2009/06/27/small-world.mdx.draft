We're planning to visit family in the Southwest this summer, and as part of our trip planning, I was looking at plane fares in New Mexico. The airline's Web site helpfully suggested that there were "multiple airports" in the cities I had selected.

I love how they suggest the <em>same,</em> alternate, "in the same city" airport for both my "from" and "to" cities. But not as much as I love the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Kunming+Airport,+Kunming,+China&sll=25.037287,102.722125&sspn=0.00663,0.011362&ie=UTF8&ll=25.005973,102.744141&spn=52.760194,93.076172&t=h&z=4&iwloc=A">alternate</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunming">they</a> <a href="http://www.chinatourstailor.com/guide/city/Kunming.htm">picked</a>.

Just for fun, I compared the fares if I went to or from the alternate airport. They cost more, but not by much.
