<strong><a href="http://barcampomaha.org/">BarCamp Omaha</a></strong> is October 2-3 (Friday evening to Saturday). I've never been to a BarCamp, but it promises to be intriguing -- the session schedule is planned on a whiteboard Saturday morning, and anyone who wants to run a session, can. It's not just a tech conference; they say the major <a href="http://barcampomaha.org/details/">tracks</a> will be Tech, Creative, and Entrepreneurship.

I understand that BarCamps are usually free, but this one costs $5. But (a) that's <em>cheap</em> (heck, I thought the HDC was cheap at <a href="http://hdc.eventbrite.com/">$200</a> -- but then again, I'm not paying for the HDC out of my own pocket) and (b) you get the full conference experience for that $5: free T-shirt (great, another one to go into the drawer), free breakfast, free lunch, and free pop and snacks all day. Free food <em>is</em> the primary reason for going to a conference, so it should feel just like home.



I'm toying with the idea of speaking at BarCamp (haven't really decided yet). Their <a href="http://barcampomaha.org/faq/">FAQ</a> says the time slots are only 30 minutes, and I'm wondering if I should take a stab at a <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2007/01/31/blog-event-the-31-days-of-resharper/">31 Minutes of ReSharper</a>. It'd take some serious editing, mind you, given that my original material was 31 <em>days</em>.

<strong>The <a href="http://www.heartlanddc.com/omaha/default.aspx">Heartland Developers Conference (HDC)</a>,</strong> a Microsoft-themed conference here in Omaha, is October 15-16. I guess I don't really need to hype it, since it's 100% sold out this year (I wonder how long until they need to start spilling over into the <em>first</em> floor of the Qwest Center?). But I'm looking forward to it just like every year, because the second-day breakfast always has all the free bacon you can eat.

Oh, and they always have some pretty awesome sessions, too. A couple years ago they had <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> from Microsoft do one of the keynotes, if that gives you any idea (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071012032309/http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/about.aspx">at the time</a>, he was Microsoft's General Manager in charge of the CLR, ASP.NET, Silverlight, WPF, and IIS, among other things). They get good people and a lot of interesting content. I can pretty much register without even looking at the session list, and know that every timeslot will have a session that's well worth my while -- and even with the economy the way it is, my boss was happy to pay all our conference registrations. There's benefits to making something cheap. (<a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a> sales department, are you listening?)
