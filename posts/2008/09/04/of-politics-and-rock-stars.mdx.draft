We watched Obama's acceptance speech last week, and we watched McCain's acceptance speech tonight.

Obama has been accused of being a "rock star". So it was interesting to notice that McCain was the one who couldn't ever get a word in edgewise, because the damn crowd wouldn't ever stop cheering and applauding and hollering and whistling and chanting "USA! USA! USA!"

For God's sake, people, shut up and let the man talk.
