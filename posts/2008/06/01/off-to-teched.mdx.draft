I'm headed to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2008/developer/default.mspx"> Microsoft TechEd</a>, and am planning to blog the sessions while I'm there.

(Note to DelphiFeeds readers: you'll only see things I think would interest Delphi users. If you want to read the C# stuff too, you'll need to come to <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/">my blog</a>, or just follow my <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/tag/teched2008/">conference posts</a>.)

It looks like there'll be plenty to keep me busy. I'm going to a preconference seminar on Monday called "Improve Software Quality with Visual Studio Team System", which is all about Microsoft's revision-control, automated-test, and continuous-integration software. It'll be interesting to see if they have anything to offer beyond what <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php">NUnit</a>, and <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a> (or <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET"> CruiseControl.NET</a>) have to offer; I'll keep you posted.

The rest of the week, I'll be going to whatever sessions look interesting. No special plan there, just <a href="http://www.peanuts.com/comics/peanuts/archive/peanuts-20080526.html">learn things</a>. And hang out at Universal Studios.

Any of you guys going to be there? Let's get in touch!
