The Delphi survey did not take me the 20 minutes they claimed.

Guys, any chance the next survey could be savable and resumable? I'd love to be able to answer a few questions when I've got time, save, and then come back to it later from another computer and pick up where I left off.

If I could save and resume, I would've been done with the survey weeks ago. As it is, I had to wait until I had an uninterrupted chunk of time to devote to it.
